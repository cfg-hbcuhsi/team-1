## The Issue    
The biggest challenge that students face when deciding if they want to go to college is often finances. The cost of tuition is always rising and there are many additional costs such as books, housing, food, and transportation. Our team was tasked with how can we use technology to help discuss financial literacy with students making their decision about higher education.    

## Our Magic Solution   
Colleges often present a lump sum number to students and this can be discouraging for students from lower incomes. We wanted to break that down and provide resources on how that large number can quickly become smaller and more manageable. Our solution provides insight on how that large number is not what you are going to pay as well as resources on campus that help save money along the way.
